This program is a simple analogy for the "ncat --chat" command. The server needs at least 2 clients to send messages. At the "NewPort-\<xxxx\>" command, the server changes the port and sends a command to all clients to reconnect. Part of the implementation for Windows does not work properly, problem with the select function. Fixes is comming...
